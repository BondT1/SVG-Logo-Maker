# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The aim of this project was to create an easy to use application that can generate a simple logo for projects without having to pay a graphic designer. It allows the user to create a logo in the shapes of either a triangle, square, or circle along with text (up to 3 characters) written over the shape. The text and shape colour can also be chosen through user input. The user inputs are made possible through inquirer and the application has also been tested with jest.
